## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Executive Summary


Through this project we have tried to build a working AI system to address some of very common problems faced by Recruiters and Hiring Manager across all industries. Recruiters are challenged with the sheer number of resumes they receive every day and frequently face the problem of how to shortlist the right candidates. More often than not they send all the resumes to hiring managers which simply shifts the problem elsewhere. Second issue is that the hiring mangers or interviewing team does not have a structured list of questions to ask the candidates, nor do they have a proper methodology of accessing one candidate over another. 
Our Intelligent Recruitment Helper solves these two problems by providing a scoring of each received resume against the Job description which gives a good indication of candidates to be shortlisted. Secondly it provides a structured list of contextualized questions to be asked during the interview which not help in effectively conducting the interview but also in objectively assessing the candidates against each other by using that questionnaire as a scoring checklist.

We have made extensive use of IPA and RPA techniques to build our system, as well as used process mapping and optimization techniques to find the right pockets for automation. 

We have designed and developed our system up to a working MVP level with core functionality. We also have done extensive market research to evaluate the market size, competing products, customer segments and have found that although the market is quite saturated in terms of available products, there are unmet needs which are still fulfilled and which our system effectively addresses. The IRH efficiently supplements the existing products by plugging in the gaps of missing functionality, without directly competing with any of them. There is a business case accompanying the product with detailed financial analysis with all cost components and revenue streams, profitability analysis, investment needs, ROI and defined breakeven points. We also have comprehensive product development plan with features roadmap and launch plans.
